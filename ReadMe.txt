For some reason, the code from the netbook won't compile, so I just copied over the actual program, which seems to work.
There are a few things that were never done on the program, and it would take some effort to get the code to compile, so I'm just leaving it as is.
If a changed assignment organizer becomes necessary, it would be easier to create a new one in C++/javascript probably. 
I think this came about because I tried to add new features but broke the existing ones in the process, and I switch to Beast from Thing2 before I could fix the errors.
